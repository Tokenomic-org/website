# Full Ownership Flow (Prompt 7)

End-to-end Web3 ownership across Tokenomic: educators upload → students buy
→ NFT minted atomically → educators withdraw — all on Base L2.

---

## 1. What's on-chain

### `TokenomicMarket.sol` (extended)

| Function | Caller | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `registerCourse(ipfsMetadataURI, priceInUSDC, consultant)` | **anyone** (caller becomes the educator) | Permissionless self-publish |
| `purchase(courseId, ipfsMetadataURI)` | student (after `usdc.approve`) | Pulls USDC, credits balances, mints cert |
| `withdrawUSDC()` | educator / consultant | Pull pending USDC credit |
| `withdrawPlatformFees(to)` | **owner only** | Sweep accumulated 5 % platform cut |
| `getCoursesByEducator(addr)` view | dashboard | List courses by educator |
| `pendingWithdrawals(addr)` / `totalEarned(addr)` view | dashboard | Earnings panel |

Purchase emits both `CoursePurchased` (legacy) and a new
`PurchaseSettled(courseId, buyer, educator, consultant, …, ipfsMetadataURI)`
event indexed by buyer **and** educator — used by the dashboard to render
"Recent sales" without an indexer.

### `TokenomicCertificate.sol` (unchanged)

ERC-721 + ERC-2981, soulbound-friendly, `mint(to, courseId, ipfsURI)` only
callable by the bound market.

Recompile + refresh the frontend ABI:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
node -e "const a=require('./artifacts/contracts/TokenomicMarket.sol/TokenomicMarket.json'); \
         require('fs').writeFileSync('./artifacts/abis/TokenomicMarket.json', \
         JSON.stringify({contractName:'TokenomicMarket',abi:a.abi},null,2));"
```

## 2. Educator upload UI

`shared/assets/js/web3-upload.js` exposes `window.TokenomicUpload`:

```js
TokenomicUpload.publishCourse({
  title, description, files: [File], priceInUSDC, consultant,
  onProgress: (stage, info) => …
}); // -> { courseId, txHash, metadataURI, fileCids }
TokenomicUpload.bindForm(formEl, opts);
```

Pinning order:
1. If `__TKN_ENV.IPFS_UPLOAD_BASE` is set, POST to the Cloudflare Worker
   (`POST /ipfs/upload` for files — `multipart/form-data` with a `file`
   field; `POST /ipfs/upload-json` for metadata JSON) — **recommended**,
   keeps the `NFT_STORAGE_TOKEN` server-side. Both endpoints are
   implemented in `workers/api-worker/index.js` with per-IP rate limiting
   and a configurable `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` guard (default 25 MB).
2. Else fall back to direct nft.storage with `__TKN_ENV.NFT_STORAGE_TOKEN`
   — **dev-only**. `_includes/env.html` intentionally does *not* emit this
   variable in production builds; never set it in Pages prod env.

The form lives at `dashboard/courses.html → #educator-upload-card` with
fields: `title`, `description`, `priceInUSDC`, `consultant`, multi-file
`files`. Status / progress / result slots use the
`data-tkn-upload-{status,progress,result,submit}` attributes.

---

## 3. Educator/Consultant dashboard

**Revenue → `/revenue/`**
- Pending USDC + lifetime earned.
- "Withdraw to wallet" button (calls `withdrawUSDC()`, shows BaseScan link).
- "My Registered Courses" table (price / active / IPFS link).
- "Recent Sales" table from `PurchaseSettled` events filtered by educator.

**Profile → `/profile/`**
- Tokenomic Score widget (see §4).
- Existing wallet summary + on-chain certificates.

**My Courses → `/my-courses/`** — adds the publish-on-chain form.
(The public listing stays at `/courses/`; the dashboard page was moved to
`/my-courses/` to avoid the Jekyll permalink collision, and every
dashboard sidebar now links to it.)

**Dashboard home → `/dashboard/`** — adds an "On-Chain Ownership" card
linking to publish, earnings, score, certificates.

All panels listen for `tokenomic:wallet-connected` and refresh when the
user connects a wallet.

---

## 4. Tokenomic Score (`getTokenomicScore`)

Pure on-chain read, no extra contract:

```
score = ownedCertificates * 10
      + lifetimePurchases * 5
      + coursesRegistered * 8
      + min(50, log10(totalEarnedUSDC + 1) * 20)
```

Returned as `{ score, breakdown }`. Easy to swap for an on-chain reputation
contract later — call site is `TokenomicAssets.getTokenomicScore(address)`.

---

## 5. Local end-to-end test (Anvil / Hardhat node)

```bash
# Terminal A
npx hardhat node            # chain 31337, prefunded accounts

# Terminal B
npx hardhat run scripts/test-full-flow.js --network localhost
```

The script:
1. Deploys MockUSDC + Certificate + Market.
2. Educator registers a course at 49.99 USDC with a consultant.
3. Student approves & purchases → asserts NFT ownership.
4. Educator withdraws, consultant withdraws, owner sweeps platform fees.
5. Reads back `getCoursesByEducator` + `PurchaseSettled` events.

Expected output ends with `✅ End-to-end flow OK`.

> **Note on Hardhat tests:** the project keeps `ethers v5` for the Express
> backend + frontend CDN (`server.js` uses `ethers.utils.verifyMessage`).
> Hardhat was installed with `--legacy-peer-deps`. The `test-full-flow.js`
> script uses `hre.ethers` which works against the bundled provider.

## 6. Base Sepolia smoke test

Set in `.env`:

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=0x…                     # funded with Sepolia ETH + USDC
BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC=https://sepolia.base.org
USDC_ADDRESS=0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e   # Circle Sepolia USDC
BASESCAN_API_KEY=…
```

Then:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network base-sepolia
# Note the printed market + certificate addresses.

# Optional smoke run (re-uses USDC_ADDRESS env var):
USDC_ADDRESS=0x036C... npx hardhat run scripts/test-full-flow.js --network base-sepolia
```

Set the Cloudflare Pages env vars for the frontend:

| Var | Value |
|---|---|
| `BASE_CHAIN_ID` | `84532` (Sepolia) or `8453` (mainnet) |
| `MARKET_CONTRACT` | deployed `TokenomicMarket` address |
| `CERTIFICATE_CONTRACT` | deployed `TokenomicCertificate` address |
| `IPFS_UPLOAD_BASE` | URL of `tokenomic-api` Worker (for pinning) |

Then redeploy Pages — the `_includes/env.html` will emit them as
`window.__TKN_ENV`.
