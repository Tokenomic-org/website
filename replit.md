# Tokenomic

Institutional DeFi education and intelligence platform built on Jekyll.

## Architecture
- **Static site generator**: Jekyll (Ruby/Jekyll not installed — site is pre-built to `_site/`)
- **Serving**: Express server (`server.js`) on port 5000, serves `_site/` static files + `/api/luma-events` proxy
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 4, jQuery, custom CSS (`style.css`, `responsive.css`)
- **Dashboard**: Alpine.js for reactivity, Chart.js for analytics
- **Web3**: Ethers.js v5 (Base L2 network), wallet-native auth (MetaMask/Rabby)
- **Backend**: Supabase (client in `/shared/assets/js/supabase-client.js`)
- **Payments**: USDC on Base L2 via Helio, 0xSplits revenue distribution (90/5/5)

## GitHub Pages Deployment
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/jekyll.yml` — deploys via `actions/jekyll-build-pages@v1`
- **Concurrency**: `cancel-in-progress: true` — new pushes cancel stuck/old deployment runs
- **Build timeout**: 10 minutes (`timeout-minutes: 10` on build job)
- **Gemfile**: Uses `github-pages` gem for compatibility with GitHub Pages built-in builder
- **Plugins**: `jekyll-feed`, `jekyll-paginate`, `jekyll-seo-tag` (all supported by github-pages)
- **Excludes**: `website/`, `vendor/`, `node_modules/`, `attached_assets/`, `.local/`, `server.js`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.replit`, `replit.nix`, `.github/` excluded in `_config.yml`
- **Important**: `_site/` is in `.gitignore` — GitHub Pages rebuilds it from source via Jekyll

## SEO & Feeds
- **RSS Feed** (`/feed.xml`) — RSS 2.0 feed with all 16 learn articles, auto-discoverable via `<link rel="alternate">` in every page `<head>`
- **Sitemap** (`/sitemap.xml`) — XML sitemap with 28 URLs (12 main pages + 16 articles), priorities and change frequencies set per page type
- **Robots.txt** (`/robots.txt`) — Allows all crawlers, points to sitemap
- All three files live in `_site/` and are served as static files by Express with proper `application/xml` content type

## Key Directories
- `_site/` — Pre-built static output (served directly in Replit, rebuilt by GitHub Pages)
- `_layouts/` — `default`, `page`, `post`, `category`, `tag_page`, `dashboard`
- `_includes/` — Jekyll partials (only actively-used includes kept; unused theme includes removed)
- `_data/` — Jekyll data files (navigation.yml)
- `_site/dashboard*/` — Dashboard pages (11 pages)
- `_site/learn/*/` — Article detail pages (13 articles, statically generated + 3 slug aliases)
- `shared/assets/js/` — Shared JS (wallet, Supabase client, site-search, profile-photo)
- `assets/` — CSS, images, fonts, JS libraries
- `assets/images/learn/` — Article images pulled from learn.tokenomic.org (cover images + inline content images)
- `scripts/` — Build scripts (scrape-articles.js, generate-article-pages.js, sync-assets.sh)
- `global-community/` — Legacy file-based community storage (replaced by GitHub repo-backed system)
- `article-comments/` — File-based article comment storage (per-slug JSON files, created on first comment via API)

## Removed (unused)
- `website/` — Legacy/backup directory (was excluded in _config.yml)
- `.sass-cache/`, `.agents/` — Cache/empty directories
- 8 unused root HTML source files (portfolio-2, services-2, blog, artists, team, join, events, services)
- 45 unused `_includes/` partials (theme variants not referenced by any layout or page)
- 19 orphaned `_site/` HTML files (old slug redirects with zero references)
- `_site/2025/`, `_site/2026/`, `_site/tag/`, `_site/category/` — Empty Jekyll archive stubs
- `search.json` — Not referenced by any JS (site-search uses Supabase data)

## Branding

## Navigation
Defined in `_data/navigation.yml`: Home, About, Experts, Learn
- Learn is a direct link (no dropdown) — the page dynamically loads category-based article sections from Supabase

## Dashboard Source Files
- 11 Jekyll source files at project root: `dashboard.html`, `dashboard-courses.html`, etc.
- Each uses `layout: dashboard` with `permalink` front matter
- Dashboard layout (`_layouts/dashboard.html`) uses `header.html` (same header as /learn/ — includes Connect Wallet button, search popup, mobile menu)
- Dashboard layout has NO page banner — goes straight from header to content
- Dashboard header has solid dark navy background (`#0A0F1A`) with tighter nav spacing
- Content extracted from pre-built `_site/` pages for GitHub Pages compatibility
- Dashboard sidebar: Dark (#0A0F1A) with Tokenomic branding, section labels (Main/Finance/Content/Progress), gold-orange active indicator
- Sidebar is hidden when no wallet is connected (wallet gate logic in web3-wallet.js showGate/hideGate)
- Banner sections removed from _site/ dashboard pages for cleaner layout
- Old inline `<style>` blocks removed from _site/ files — all dashboard styling now from dashboard.css
- Alpine.js (3.13.3 CDN) loaded in dashboard layout for reactive UI components
- Font Awesome (6.4.0 CDN) loaded in dashboard layout for icons
- Search scripts (simple-jekyll-search.min.js, site-search.js) loaded for header search functionality

## Learn/Articles System
- Articles originally from learn.tokenomic.org, now pulled to main site
- Article content scraped and stored in `scripts/articles-data.json`
- Article images downloaded to `assets/images/learn/` (cover images + inline content images)
- **Jekyll source files**: `learn/*.html` — 13 article pages + 3 redirect aliases, each with front matter (`layout: article`, `permalink`, `title`, `slug`, `category`, `date`, `author`, `featured_image`, `reading_time`, author profile fields)
- **Article layout**: `_layouts/article.html` — extends `default` layout, includes header, page banner with breadcrumbs, article detail section (meta, title, author, featured image, body, share buttons, expert profile card, comments)
- **Article CSS**: `assets/css/article.css` — article detail styles (typography, share buttons, expert card, comments form); loaded conditionally via `default.html` when `page.layout == 'article'`
- **OG meta tags**: Dynamic title, og:title, og:type, og:url, og:image, twitter:card added to `_layouts/default.html` head for article pages
- **`_site/` pages**: Pre-built by `scripts/generate-article-pages.js` (for Replit preview); `_site/` is in `.gitignore` so GitHub Pages uses Jekyll source files
- **To regenerate source files**: `node scripts/generate-article-sources.js` (creates `learn/*.html` from `scripts/articles-data.json`)
- **To regenerate `_site/` pages**: `node scripts/generate-article-pages.js` (creates `_site/learn/[slug]/index.html`)
- Demo data in supabase-client.js uses local image paths (`/assets/images/learn/`)
- Site search (site-search.js) searches across articles, educators, and consultants — matches on names, descriptions/bios, specialties, categories, and keywords; results shown with color-coded type badges (orange=Article, green=Educator, blue=Consultant); popup HTML is dynamically injected if missing from the page
- 13 articles across Strategy, Technical, and Market categories
- Slug aliases (redirect pages) for alternate URL patterns: `arbitrage-practical-guide`, `advanced-options-defi`, `smart-contract-security-basics`

## Important Notes
- Ruby/Jekyll is NOT installed locally — cannot run `jekyll build`
- All visible changes in Replit must be made in `_site/` files directly
- Source files (`_includes/`, `_layouts/`, etc.) are for Jekyll builds (GitHub Pages)
- Dashboard layout exists at `_layouts/dashboard.html` for dashboard source pages
- When editing dashboard pages, update BOTH the `_site/` version (for Replit) and the source `.html` file (for GitHub Pages)
- Footer is included in default layout (`_layouts/default.html`) and dashboard layout

## Dual-File Architecture (CRITICAL)
This project has a **dual-file architecture** that must be maintained:
- **`_site/`** = What users see in Replit (served by Express). Edit these for immediate changes.
- **Source files** (`assets/`, `shared/`, `_includes/`, `_layouts/`) = For Jekyll/GitHub Pages builds.
- **ALWAYS edit BOTH** when changing CSS, JS, HTML includes, or templates.

### Files that must stay in sync:
| Source File | _site/ Copy |
|---|---|
| `assets/css/style.css` | `_site/assets/css/style.css` |
| `assets/css/dashboard.css` | `_site/assets/css/dashboard.css` |
| `assets/css/article.css` | `_site/assets/css/article.css` |
| `shared/assets/js/site-search.js` | `_site/shared/assets/js/site-search.js` |
| `shared/assets/js/supabase-client.js` | `_site/shared/assets/js/supabase-client.js` |
| `shared/assets/js/web3-wallet.js` | `_site/shared/assets/js/web3-wallet.js` |
| `_includes/header.html` | Inline in each `_site/` page (manual sync) |
| `_includes/footer.html` | Inline in each `_site/` page (manual sync) |

### Sync script: `bash scripts/sync-assets.sh`
Run after editing any source CSS/JS file to sync to `_site/`.

### Common pitfalls to avoid:
- **Never use `.html` extensions in links** — use root-relative paths like `/contact/`, `/services/`, `/training/`
- **CSS top offsets** — headers use `position: fixed; top: 0;` — never add top offsets
- **Search popup** — dynamically injected by `site-search.js` on all pages; no manual HTML needed
- **Copyright year** — auto-generated by JavaScript, not hardcoded
- **Header inline styles** — search button & wallet button alignment defined in `<style>` block in header includes; must be present on every page
- **When editing _site/ HTML pages in bulk** — use `find _site -name "*.html" -exec sed ...` for consistency
